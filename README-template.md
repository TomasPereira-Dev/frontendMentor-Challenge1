## Overview

This project consist in a very simple centered component divided into 2 different containers. An ideal project for people who just started with CSS, learn the basics of Flexbox, or for someone who needs to practice and refresh their memory after a long time away from coding.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Make a replica of the proposed project, as close to the original as possible and make it responsive so it can be seen right in smartphones.

## My process

I started with this challenges because, when working in a personal project i notice that my positioning skills were not that great, i needed to improve if my goal was to get a job in this field, so instead of feeling bad and stay on my bed all day i decided to get my hands dirty and start working on it, on having a better eye for small details.

I have already 2 years coding, most of my focus went to React and JS, so it was not very hard to do.

The first thing i did was building the HTML and add the nesessary classes to every element that i needed to modify after looking closely to the image given by the project.
Because the project consisted in 2 separated sections (the total score and the summary), they were separated in 2 diferent containers, wrapped in a father container to center it in the middle of the screen, adding heigth: 100% to the html, and body and using flexbox to aling it to the center of the page after that i started with the summary section, using flexblox gives you the chance of use the gap property, that alows you to add a gap between every element in the container,  so i added like agap of 1em,then for the color of the diferent categories i used a chrome extention called ColorZilla to pick the exact color for them, it were pretty much the same color of the font buth more transparent, like a very bright tint, also for curiosity i used Coolors to see how far the tint was from the original color.
